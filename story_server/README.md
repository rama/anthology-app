#  Backend server with Django + Postgres

This is a Django project with a Postgres DB.


## Getting Started

### 1. Set up a virtual environment
```
# On macOS/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv

# On Windows:
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment
```
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:

```

You should now see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the server

### 5. Log in to the admin site
